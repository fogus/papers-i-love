Computer science and computer-adjacent papers (and sometimes books) that have influenced me deeply.

## Favorites

It's very difficult to pick only a handful and call them my favorites. I've [tried in the past](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/) with varying success, but honestly my top picks today will likely be different next week. That said, here are a few that I truly love.
